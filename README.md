# Cisco Packet Tracer mini lab!
This project was a deep dive into core Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching concepts, designed to simulate a scalable enterprise network.

🔧 Key Technologies Implemented:

1. ✅ Configured hostname as per topology and enable RPVST on all switch - RPVST+ (Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree) for optimized loop prevention.

2. ✅ Assigned Interfaces as per VLAN in topology and enabled Port Fast for port that connect to machine - Port Fast to accelerate host connectivity.

3. ✅ Configured Trunk for uplink - Trunk for VLAN propagation across switches.

4. ✅ Configured Root switches as SW1 and SW2 as Root switches secondary - STP to prevent loops.

5. ✅ Configured S1 VTP is the server and all others switch are clients - VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) for centralized VLAN management.

6. ✅ Router as a stick according to the Topology - ROAS (Router-on-a-Stick) for inter-VLAN routing.

Custom VLANs for segmentation and traffic isolation.
